# Data-scaling-for-machine-learning-algorithms-
This project aimed to evaluate four machine learning (ML) algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Artificial Neural Network (LogR), Linear Regression (LinR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and 5 different data scaling methods, Normalisation (NS), Standscale (SS), MinMax (MM), MaxAbs (MA) and Robust Scaler (RS) on a dataset comprising of daily Amazon stock information from 2011 to 2022. The results show that the SVM and Linear regression model alongside the MM and QT scaling methods outperform all other ML algorithms with 87% and 99% accuracy respectively The results of the study show that the model's performance changes depending on the data scaling technique.

A project submitted in partial fulfilment for the degree of MSC Data Science
